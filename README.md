# project_zebrafish

The project is a part of a scientific work on cranyosinostosis developpement. Animal model of Zebrafish is used.
The research is still ongoing in the host laboratory, so the data (P-SHG images) can not be uploaded for the public use. 

The aim of this project was to implement a pipeline for geometrical correction of P-SHG images visualizing the directions of collagen strands 
in the skull bones of Zebrafish. Segmentation, line extraction, angle correction based on the tangent direction and a color correction are implemented.
The desciption of each module can be found at the top of the page of each file.
